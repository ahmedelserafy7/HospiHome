## Description

[**HospiHome**](https://youtu.be/Ug_Qoxyx45E) is an application that connects patients to doctors remotely using an iOS device. In other words, it is an e-clinic.

## What's the problem?
With the increasing number of **Covid-19**ü¶† cases daily worldwide, the risk on the doctors is also increasing. **Doctors**ü•º may deal with up-to 1000 patients daily and if a single patient is infected with Covid-19 the doctor, his family, and all the other patients are going to be infected.

Regarding the **patients**, some patients are worried to go to clinics or hospitals, so not to be infected with Covid-19.

## How we can solve this?
In a tech era with everything done from the ease of our desk, we thought why not to also be able to consult a doctor from the ease of our desk. Not only will it save the patients time & effort, but it will also save the patients, and doctors from getting infected in such a severe time of the pandemic. 

As stated before the main idea of the app is allowing a remote consultation with doctors, this is going to be done through a video chat between the doctor and the patient at the previously reserved time slot, and after the payment.
In addition to being able to make reservations using an automated slots system at any time of the day. This eliminates the need of having a clerk to reserve time slots for the consultations. It‚Äôs also important that this can be done 24/7.

### Have some rest ü•§üçø 

Moreover, there will be a text chat feature that allows the patient and the doctor to communicate without sharing their personal contact information protecting the privacy for both parties.
The patient will have access to a huge list of different doctors in different specialties allowing him to check all the available doctors, their fees and their reviews to facilitate the choosing process.

By implementing the above application, we‚Äôre saving both the doctors and the patients from a severe virus that may affect them, and we‚Äôre starting a new era in the 
field that can open new opportunities in the **medical field** and may also break the geographical boundaries letting patients connect with doctors from around the world.
